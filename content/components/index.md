title: Components
---

This section is meant to describe the components of your library (or libraries).

Create a separate page for each component or a group of components, and list the pages in the side menu.

## Page structure

Each design system has its own structure for the component pages. You should find your own which meets the needs
of designers and developers using this documentation.

However, you can follow the general guidelines, like the following.

* Explain the purpose of the component
* Describe when it should be used
* Demonstrate the use cases with "do and don't" blocks
* Provide live examples
* Give code samples

## Documenting features

### Code examples

Provide code examples.

```jsx
<AwesomeButton type="primary">Primary</AwesomeButton>
```

### Live code examples

Code examples can render live.

```jsx live
<AwesomeButton type="primary">Primary</AwesomeButton>
```

### Dos and donts

Use "Do and dont" block to explain how to use the component.
