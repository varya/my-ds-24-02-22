They notify to the user that their request is being processed. Although they do not provide details about what is occurring on the back-end, they reassure the user that their action is being processed.\n\nUse a loading spinner whenever the wait time is anticipated to be longer than three seconds.\n\n### Types of spinners\n\nClassic spinner is a rotating unclosed circle.\n\n```jsx live nocode\n<Spinner name=\"ball-clip-rotate\" />\n```\n\nIn some designs, this shape is modified to match the other styles.\n\n```jsx live nocode\n<Spinner name=\"circle\" />\n```\n\nThere can be other shapes of spinners. Sometimes it is the shape what creates connection to specific application.\n\n```jsx live nocode\n<Spinner name=\"line-scale\" />\n```\n\n### Branding spinners\n\nSpinners should be aligned with other brand elements and used the color from the design system\npalette.\n\n```jsx live nocode\n<Spinner name=\"circle\" color=\"coral\" />\n```\n\n## Documenting\n\nFor the sake of visual consistency it is good to provide the living examples\nin special blocks (as you could see above.\n\nHowever, you can choose to put it inline in the very\ndocumenttaion text.\n\n<Spinner name=\"pulse\" />\n\nLooks amazing!\n\n## Code\n\nThis spinner is a React component and can be used as the following.\n\n```jsx\n<Spinner name=\"circle\" />\n```\n\nChanging that `name` and `color` attributes you can change its visual. Play around\nwith this live example. Try to give it a name `hree-bounce` and color `orange`. You can also write a text before or after it.\n\n```jsx live\n<Spinner name=\"folding-cube\" color=\"fuchsia\"/> loading...\n```\n\n## Component props\n\n| Name                     | Type    |    Default     | Description                                                                                               |\n| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| name                     | String  | 'three-bounce' | Name of spinner.

To make it happen, we put this component to the global scope listing it in\n`markdown-components.js`\n\n```js\nimport Spinner from \"react-spinkit\"\n\nexport default {\n  // ... other libs and/or components here\n  Spinner,\n}\n```\n","editUrl":"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/edit/master/content/components/spinner.md","fileRelativePath":"content/components/spinner.md","contributors":[],"tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#usage","title":"Usage","items":[{"url":"#types-of-spinners","title":"Types of spinners"},{"url":"#branding-spinners","title":"Branding spinners"}]},{"url":"#documenting","title":"Documenting"},{"url":"#code","title":"Code"},{"url":"#component-props","title":"Component props"},{"url":"#how-this-page-works","title":"How this page works"}]},"frontmatter":{"path":"components/spinner","title":"Spinner"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1352237475","1352237475","2468112454","2468112454","3309604493","3309604493"]}
