The design system components should meet the needs of a diverse audience—including those with disabilities that use assistive technology to access digital content. Including and respecting diversity in the design process, esures that barriers are lowered and everyone can access the content they need.\n\nAccessibility not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone.\n\nAn accessible product should:\n\n- Give all users the same quality of experience\n- Adapt to users and situations\n\n### Blind users\n\n#### How they experience an interface\n\n- May use a screen reader to experience interfaces\n- May rely on Braille output\n- Cannot be expected to use a pointer or mouse for input\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Is visual information translated effectively into text? Can the image be\n  understood through its metadata alone?\n- When possible, test all designs through a screen reader.\n\n#### How this applies to everyone\n\n- As audio-only interfaces gain popularity through devices like AI assistants,\n  users are expecting more and more from the audio representations of\n  experiences.\n\n### Low-vision users\n\nLow vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes and can range from mild\nto severe. It affects approximately 4% of the world’s population.\n\n#### How they experience an interface\n\n- May use screen readers, screen magnifiers, high-contrast modes, and/or\n  monochrome displays\n- May have their browser font size adjusted to a larger setting\n- May not use adaptive technology at all\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Maximize the readability and visual clarity of content.\n- Consider how the relative proximity of information changes when a page is\n  magnified.\n- Follow\n  [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/)\n  and test with a screen reader to ensure the page is read to the user in a\n  logical order.\n- To gain a better understanding of the various low vision disabilities, use the\n  [NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl)\n  Chrome plugin to preview websites.\n\n#### How this applies to everyone\n\n- Users without disabilities sometimes need to view screens in poor lighting\n  conditions. For example, it's difficult to see a screen outside on a bright\n  day. A higher-contrast design will make the screen more usable for everyone.\n- Vision worsens gradually starting around age 40, and good contrast helps this\n  very large demographic use your interface.\n\n### Color-blind users\n\nColor-blindness affects 8% of all men and 0.4% of women.\n\n#### How they experience an interface\n\n- Will not be able to differentiate between some colors on an interface\n- Rely on non-color information to use an interface\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Carbon color themes strive to comply with the\n  [WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/). The\n  color palette should ensure you avoid contrast issues when used correctly. If\n  you're working in Sketch, we recommend the [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/)\n  plugin.\n  <!-- - To view best practices for using color in Data Visualization, view the [Data Vis](/data-visualization/overview/colors) color page. -->\n\n### Low vision\n\nLow vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes and can range from mild\nto severe. It affects about 4% of the world’s population.\n\n| Type                       | Visual deficiency                                                                        |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Low acuity_               | Also known as \"blurred vision\". Can make text difficult to read, since it appears fuzzy. |\n| _Low contrast sensitivity_ | Decreased ability to determine fine detail and distinguish one object from another       |\n| _Obstructed visual field_  | The user's view is partially obstructed. Can include central vision and spotty vision.   |\n| _Retinitis Pigmentosa_     | Also known as \"tunnel vision\". The user is only able to see central elements.            |\n\n#### Designing for low vision\n\nTo get an understanding of the various low vision disabilities, we recommend\nusing the\n[NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl)\nChrome plugin to preview websites. Low vision users may be using a screen reader\nto preview your website or experience, so be sure to follow\n[keyboard guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/keyboard) to ensure the page is\nread to the user in a logical order.\n\n### Deaf and hard-of-hearing users\n\n#### How they experience an interface\n\n- May rely on closed captioning and other alternative representations of audio\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Find an alternative way to convey information exclusively with sound.\n- Transcribe and caption all videos and animations that have meaningful audio.\n\n#### How this applies to everyone\n\n- All users can benefit from closed captioning. Imagine using your device in a\n  loud environment or, alternatively, in a quiet environment when it wouldn't be\n  appropriate to turn your sound on.\n\n### Physical disabilities\n\n#### How users with physical disabilities experience an interface\n\n- May rely on keyboards, track balls, voice recognition, and other assistive\n  technologies to interact with an interface\n- May not be able to use a keyboard, mouse, or other pointer\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Design for keyboard interaction\n- Learn how to navigate using a\n  [keyboard](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-nav.html.en)\n  and spend some time navigating the web and digital products like email using\n  only the keyboard.\n\n#### How this applies to everyone\n\n- Many users prefer to navigate interfaces with a keyboard and no mouse for\n  efficiency. Good keyboard navigation can help everyone be more productive.\n\n### Users with cognitive disabilities\n\nFunctional cognitive disabilities can result in difficulties with:\n\n- Memory\n- Problem solving\n- Attention\n- Reading, linguistic, and verbal comprehension\n- Mathematics\n- Visual comprehension\n\n#### How they experience an interface\n\n- May have limited working memory and need information to remain visible\n  throughout the completion of a task\n- May experience seizures when exposed to flashing content due to epilepsy\n\n#### What designers should think about\n\n- Designers should avoid complex language, autoplaying animations and videos,\n  and flashing animations. Designs should pass usability heuristics, such as\n  cognitive walkthroughs, to ensure users do not feel overloaded when completing\n  tasks.\n- Design in as linear a fashion as possible and focus on design heuristics that\n  have to do with cognitive load and memory.\n\n#### How this applies to everyone\n\n- Best practices for cognitive disabilities benefit all users. Busy environments\n  can tax your cognitive load. Aging adults may also experience a decline in\n  cognitive abilities. Placing a low cognitive load on users reduces mistakes\n  and improves effectiveness, regardless of their abilities.\n\n## Global accessibility standards\n\n- [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (W3C)'s Web Accessibility\n  Initiative (WAI) provides resources to improve the accessibility of the World\n  Wide Web.\n- Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain the\n  [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG),\n  the global accessibility standard.\n\n## Approach\n\nAccessibility is a multifaceted challenge that requires a variety of methods to ensure that all users can access content in a way that works for them.\n\nAs part of our process, Workday fosters understanding of the different experiences that users face. To do this, we:\n\n- Promote human-centered design\n- Design products with POUR (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) principles in mind\n- Work closely with all stakeholders, including our customer partners and end users\n- Solicit feedback on features and functionality by people with disabilities\n- Host workshops facilitated by accessibility experts\n- Encourage use of our empathy lab\n","editUrl":"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/edit/master/content/guidelines/accessibility.md","fileRelativePath":"content/guidelines/accessibility.md","contributors":[],"tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#overview","title":"Overview","items":[{"url":"#blind-users","title":"Blind users","items":[{"url":"#how-they-experience-an-interface","title":"How they experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about","title":"What designers should think about"},{"url":"#how-this-applies-to-everyone","title":"How this applies to everyone"}]},{"url":"#low-vision-users","title":"Low-vision users","items":[{"url":"#how-they-experience-an-interface-1","title":"How they experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about-1","title":"What designers should think about"},{"url":"#how-this-applies-to-everyone-1","title":"How this applies to everyone"}]},{"url":"#color-blind-users","title":"Color-blind users","items":[{"url":"#how-they-experience-an-interface-2","title":"How they experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about-2","title":"What designers should think about"}]},{"url":"#low-vision","title":"Low vision","items":[{"url":"#designing-for-low-vision","title":"Designing for low vision"}]},{"url":"#deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-users","title":"Deaf and hard-of-hearing users","items":[{"url":"#how-they-experience-an-interface-3","title":"How they experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about-3","title":"What designers should think about"},{"url":"#how-this-applies-to-everyone-2","title":"How this applies to everyone"}]},{"url":"#physical-disabilities","title":"Physical disabilities","items":[{"url":"#how-users-with-physical-disabilities-experience-an-interface","title":"How users with physical disabilities experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about-4","title":"What designers should think about"},{"url":"#how-this-applies-to-everyone-3","title":"How this applies to everyone"}]},{"url":"#users-with-cognitive-disabilities","title":"Users with cognitive disabilities","items":[{"url":"#how-they-experience-an-interface-4","title":"How they experience an interface"},{"url":"#what-designers-should-think-about-5","title":"What designers should think about"},{"url":"#how-this-applies-to-everyone-4","title":"How this applies to everyone"}]}]},{"url":"#global-accessibility-standards","title":"Global accessibility standards"},{"url":"#approach","title":"Approach"}]},"frontmatter":{"path":null,"title":"Accessibility"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1352237475","1352237475","2468112454","2468112454","3309604493","3309604493"]}
